# Abstract 
This project is based on the second development of Alibaba's open source Java diagnostic tool Arthas, you can use the link below to jump to the details of Arthas
[English Documentation](README_EN.md)

# Background
In this project, we enhanced Arthas with features like improved thread blocking detection, deadlock detection, and method call tracing for better real-time monitoring and fault diagnosis in Java applications, especially in complex, distributed systems. We also created an automated script for production environments that captures critical diagnostic information when a pod fails, enabling faster root cause analysis and reducing downtime. Additionally, we developed a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for using Arthas to diagnose common production issues, providing a systematic approach for efficient troubleshooting. These enhancements empower teams to monitor system health, diagnose performance issues, and resolve problems with minimal disruption, improving the robustness and reliability of production systems.

In terms of function, our project mainly realizes the following three functions: Thread Blocking Troubleshooting Feature, Deadlock Troubleshooting Feature and Multi-level Method Call Tracing Feature.
